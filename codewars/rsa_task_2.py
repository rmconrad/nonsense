# Task_2:
# write a function that calculates the modulus and totient of the two prime numbers entered into the script
# (that pass our test) where:
# this will be the basis of our public key
# the modulous is the two prime numbers multiplied together m(p,q)
# the totient is the  two prime numbers -1 multipled together t(p-1,q-1)
